      Anyway, the creation of a new profile will you solve a captcha, wait for an activation email, insert

      You can skip all this boring process by logging in with Facebook.

      Personal identity matters for our application. You should be able to trust your new travel companions and Facebook provides
      a first verification through friends, friends of friends...
